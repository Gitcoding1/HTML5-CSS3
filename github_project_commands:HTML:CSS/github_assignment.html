      <h2>Git Basics</h2>
      <p>Git is a version control system; you can think of it as a series of snapshots (commits) of your code base. with the creation of each snapshot you bulid out a whole application, seeing the growth of a flll app. During this time you cna make branches
        to experiment and come back to a previous snapshot you took or merge those experiments into the your app.</p>
      <h2> What is GitHub?</h2>
      <p>GitHub is a code hosting paltform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere using those code snapshots that you took during developmemt.</p>

       <h3>Git remote add</h3>
       <p><span class="color1">Git remote add</span> is used to set up an online repository were we can place all of our current code. This is where the outside world can see out code base.</p>

    <h3>Git push</h3>
    <p><span class="color1">Git push</span> is how we get our code to Github, an excellent place to store all of our repositories. Others developers might look at our existing projects to see how we approched problems, pull down our code and add new features or even update our code base with features ther wanted to add</p>
